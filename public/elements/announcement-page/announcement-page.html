                <p> STOCAZZO Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister
                    on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had
                    peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no
                    pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,'
                    thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'</p>
                <p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,
                    for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether
                    the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble
                    of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White
                    Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>
                <p>There was nothing so <i>very</i> remarkable in that; nor did
                    Alice think it so <i>very</i> much out of the way to hear the
                    Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when
                    she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought
                    to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite
                    natural); but when the Rabbit actually <i>took a watch out of its
                        waistcoat-pocket,</i> and looked at it, and then hurried on,
                    Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that
                    she had never before seen a rabbit with either a
                    waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with
                    curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was
                    just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the
                    hedge.</p>
